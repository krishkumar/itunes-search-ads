# Introduction to iTunes Search Ads

## Running a campaign on iTunes App Store

As part of [signup](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search-ads/) you will need to create a Search Ads account. Once you have an account you are ready to create campaigns.

1. Choose your app from the list of apps

2. Choose an Ad Group Name

3. Choose Storefronts. For now only United States is available and auto selected.

4. Choose Devices - iPad and iPhone

5. You can select the schedule of your ads down to the time of the day with Ad Scheduling. Scheduling is based on the user's time zone.

6. Default Max CPT Bid

  This is the most important part of setting up search ads. First consider what is one customer worth to you?

  Apple's formula to calculate your CPT (cost per tap) is based on two parameters -

  * How much are your willing to spend per customer? Say $2.50.

  * How many people who tap the ad will also download the app? Say 40%.

  Your CPT is now 40% of $2.50 = $1

  You can setup budgets and cap daily spends per campaign.

7. Additionally you can also set a CPA (cost per acquistion) goal. Read up on [CPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_action) here.

8. Choose Search Match.

9. Keywords and Group Keywords

  Search Ads will auto reccomend keywords for your app. You can place bids on the keywords you want to be matched for. The popularity of keywords is show here which is really useful.

  You can also choose Group Keywords for matching groups of keywords that you want to be matched for.

  With the Ad Group Negative Keywords list, you can select keywords for which you don't want to be matched for.

10. Audience
Finally choose your customer types. You can choose between new users, existing users, users who have already downloaded your other apps. Or just everyone.

  Choose the demographics of people you are targeting by selecting their age.

  You can also choose to target your ad to specific locations.

That's it. Your campaign is now ready.

Make sure you add a credit card to the Search Ads Account. Your campaign will be on hold until you add a payment method.
